# SpeechSync

## Step 1: Planning the App
### 1.1 Project Scope
Speech Sync will allow users to upload video files, choose a language, and automatically generate subtitles. The application will likely rely on speech-to-text (STT) APIs or AI services, such as Google's Speech-to-Text or OpenAI's Whisper, to transcribe the audio.

### 1.2 Main Features:
User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
Video Upload: Upload a video file (support for multiple formats like MP4, AVI).
Language Selection: Select the language for subtitle generation.
Subtitle Generation: Transcribe and synchronize subtitles using STT APIs.
Subtitle Preview & Download: View and download the generated subtitles in formats like .srt or .vtt.
Payment Integration: To monetize the service (for example, charge for batch processing or video length).
Dashboard/History: Users can view the history of subtitle generations, download previous files, etc.
### 1.3 User Personas & Expected Users
Content Creators: YouTubers, vloggers, and streamers who need subtitles for their videos.
Educators: Teachers or course creators who want captions for online lessons.
Companies: Businesses creating promotional videos that need multilingual subtitles.
Freelancers: Video editors and marketers providing subtitle services for clients.
### 1.4 Tech Stack (Proposal)
Frontend: React.js (for UI), Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap (for styling).
Backend: Node.js or Python (Flask/Django) with API integration for subtitle generation.
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB (to store user profiles, history, etc.).
Cloud/Hosting: AWS/GCP for hosting and storage (video files, subtitle downloads).
APIs for STT: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or OpenAI Whisper API.

Devops: Docker for merging all technology
## Step 2: Design Phase (Frontend)
Now that we know the app's scope, letâ€™s start planning its interface:

### 2.1 Wireframes & Mockups
Homepage: This will have a brief description of the service, a call to action (CTA) like "Upload a Video," and maybe pricing or a demo video.
Signup/Login Page: Users should be able to sign up or log in using email, Google, or other OAuth providers.
Dashboard: Once logged in, the user should see a dashboard with options to:
Upload a new video.
View previously generated subtitles.
View account information.
Payment history (if required).
Upload Page: Here, users can upload a video, choose the language, and click "Generate Subtitles." This page should also show the upload progress and the current status of the subtitle generation.
Subtitle Preview Page: After subtitle generation, users can view the video with subtitles and download the file.
You can create these mockups using tools like Figma or Adobe XD.

### 2.2 User Flow
Here's a basic user flow for Speech Sync:

User visits the homepage.
User registers and logs in.
From the dashboard, they upload a video.
They select the language for subtitles and hit "Generate."
The system processes the video and generates subtitles.
User previews and downloads the subtitles.
(If applicable) User proceeds to payment based on the video length or services used.

### 2.3 UI/UX Considerations
Responsive Design: Make sure the app works on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
User-friendly Layout: Ensure that uploading a video and generating subtitles are intuitive.
Error Handling: Provide clear error messages (e.g., "Unsupported file type").
Real-time Feedback: Show loading animations or progress bars during file upload or subtitle generation.
